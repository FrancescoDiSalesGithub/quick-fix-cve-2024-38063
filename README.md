quick powershell script to fix cve-2024-38063

# How to run 

Firstly on your windows system you should check for the execution policy:

```
Get-ExectionPolicy
```

If it is Unrestricted you can run the script without problems. If it isn't the case:

```
Set-ExectionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

After that the Execution policy is unrestricted then run the script:
```
.\cve-2024-38063-fix.ps1
```

When the script has done, check on the control panel at the network adapter configuration window, and you should see the ipv6 checkbox disabled.
